financial loss for the company.

exceeding a specified number of days on at least one of the initial 
loan installments.

• Approved: The company approves the loan application. 

• Cancelled: The client cancels the application during approval, either 
due to a change of mind or receiving unfavorable pricing. 

• Refused: The company rejects the loan application based on client 
requirements, among other factors. 

• Unused offer: The client cancels the loan after approval at different 
stages of the process.
